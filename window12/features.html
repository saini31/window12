<h4>Will Windows 12 be a free upgrade?</h4>
<p>
  One of the big questions you're likely to have is whether you'll have to pay
  to upgrade to Windows 12 when (and if) it releases, but thankfully, that's
  unlikely. Microsoft has been set on offering major Windows updates for free to
  existing Windows users for a few years now, and it only makes sense for that
  to continue. Of course,<br />
  Windows 12 itself likely won't be free, so if you don't have a Windows license
  at all, you're still going to have to buy it.
</p>

<p>
  It's been suggested by some reports that Microsoft might introduce a
  subscription service for Windows 12, but that's not going to happen.<br />
  You won't have to pay a recurring fee to use Windows 12. Of course, you'll
  still need to buy a license if you're building a custom PC and don't have a
  valid Windows 10 or 11 license right now, just as with previous releases.
</p>

<p>
  What might get you to spend money is whether your PC is compatible with it,
  but that's a different matter worthy of its own section.
</p>

<h4>Will I be forced to upgrade?</h4>
The most likely answer to this is no. Microsoft has significantly eased up on
its push to get users to install new versions of Windows by force. Windows 11 is
still an optional update for Windows 10 users, and most likely, that approach
will continue with future releases. Updating to new versions of Windows can be
mandatory if your version of Windows is nearing the end of its support period.
For example, the original release of Windows 11 will be supported for 24 months
if you have a Home or Pro edition of Windows, so by now, you need to have
updated to a newer version, since those two years have passed.

<h4>Windows 11 updates</h4>
However, if you look at what's happening with Windows 10, Microsoft is still
delivering security updates for that operating system, and you don't have to
upgrade to Windows 11. Windows 10 as a whole is supported until October 2025,
and instead of pushing users to Windows 11, Microsoft is keeping them on Windows
10 unless they want to upgrade. It's likely that Windows 11 will receive the
same treatment once Windows 12 is released, so you won't be forced to upgrade.

<h4>Can my PC run Windows 12?</h4>
After Windows 11 significantly raised the minimum system requirements compared
to Windows 10, this is another great question to ponder. Will Windows 12 leave
older PCs behind once again? It's too early to say, but there's certainly a
chance that some PCs won't be compatible for one reason or another. Windows 11
currently requires processors released from around 2018 onward, and while we
currently don't see a reason for the next Windows release to require more than
that, it's possible that will happen. <br />As for any other requirements,
again, it's hard to say. Windows 11 requires 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal
storage, so at the very least, Windows 12 will need just as much. You also
shouldn't expect Microsoft to walk back on things like TPM requirements.
However, if history is any indication, <br />there will likely continue to be
some kind of workaround that unsupported PCs can use to install it if you're
feeling adventurous. Either way, almost all the best laptops you can buy today
will likely support Windows 12 when it is released.

<h4>What's new in Windows 12?</h4>
It's still too early to know for sure what Windows 12 will encompass. However,
some reports and leaks have given us a look at what might be part of this major
update.

<h4>More AI capabilities</h4>
AI has been a core focus of Windows for the past year or so, and if recent
reports are to be believed, that will only be more true with Windows 12. The
next version of Windows will weave AI into every part of the experience, rather
than just having a Copilot sidebar. Reports suggest Windows 12 will be able to
do things like interpret natural language search queries to find your documents
and files. For example, you might write "show me the documents I was working on
last week", and it will surface those documents. This is thanks to an "advanced
copilot", which will also remember everything you;ve looked at on your PC and
create a timeline of sorts, which you can jump back into at any time. This si
similar to a feature that was present on Windows 10. Additionally, these AI
features will include the ability to not only caption video in real time (which
Windows 11 already does) but also translate the captions on the fly. Other AI
features include a "Super Resolution" capability to upscale the quality of
videos and games you play on your PC. Additionally, AI will be used to generate
a parallax effect for your photos when you use them as a desktop background.

<h4>A new desktop UI</h4>
Microsoft inadvertently showed off a concept for Windows 12 during the Microsoft
Ignite keynote hosted by CEO Satya Nadella. The concept shows a few interesting
changes, including a floating taskbar and some system icons that are now
displayed at the top of the screen, such as the Wi-Fi and battery indicators,
along with a weather widget. This would make Windows more similar to macOS or
some Linux distributions. Screenshot of a Windows desktop with a redesigned
toolbar and system icons at the top of the screen Other changes that have been
reported include a new lock screen and login UI that's more optimized for touch
devices, and a new notification center that can group notifications by contact,
and not just by app. It's also expected you might be able to pin widgets to the
desktop rather than having to use the dedicated widgets panel. Recently, it's
also been reported that the Start menu will see some changes, with a new Creator
area housing links to Microsoft 365 apps like Designer, Clipchamp, and
PowerPoint.

<h4>New energy efficiency features</h4>
Another big focus for Windows 12 seems to be energy efficiency and
sustainability, with a couple of new features in tow to address just that.
According to recent reports, Windows 12 will feature some energy saver
improvements that can extend battery life by up to 50%. Another noteworthy
capability is being able to set your laptop to prefer charging when the power
grid in your area is using renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions as a
result.

<h4>more modular approach</h4>

According to reports, Microsoft is working on a modular version of Windows
that's tailored and adapted to different form factors and devices. For example,
a lower-end tablet or foldable PC may not support classic Win32 apps in order to
have a lighter build. However, that feature would still be available on
traditional desktop PC, so long-time users can still use their PC just as they
always have. On top of that, <br />this modular approach also enables more
seamless updates and more security, because certain parts of the OS are blocked
off from user access, and thus can't be corrupted easily. This is somewhat
reminiscent of what Microsoft was<br />
attempting with Windows 10X, which was going to be a version of Windows 10
designed for more modern devices and foldables. But while Windows 10X stripped
out everything <br />it could and was built from the ground up for these
devices, the goal with Windows 12 is to have the full set of features and then
remove the bits that don't make sense for a particular device or form factor.
<br />This will result in lighter Windows installations, allowing the OS to run
on even lower-end hardware to compete with ChromeOS. However, it's important to
note that this modular version of <br />Windows won't come with a <br />Windows
12 update. Devices will have to ship with this release, and it likely won't be
ready when Windows 12 is initially launched. In fact, it's currently not known
when it will be ready.

<h4>No more support for 32-bit Arm apps and better Arm optimization</h4>
<p>
  While it's not a new feature, it was recently confirmed that the next version
  of Windows will not support 32-bit Arm apps, following in the footsteps of
  other Arm-centric platforms. Officially, Microsoft says this change is
  happening with a future version of Windows 11,<br />
  but we'll have to wait and see when it ends up happening. <br />Microsoft has
  also mentioned it's working on improvements for Arm devices, including more
  efficient emulation of x86 apps. This was mentioned briefly during the
  Qualcomm <br />Snapdragon Summit keynote, but it's unclear what these
  improvements are or when they will arrive.
</p>

<h4>What we want to see in Windows 12</h4>
<p>
  Of course, with a major Windows release on the way, we can't help but imagine
  all the changes it should make to improve the Windows experience. While we
  love Windows 11, there's definitely a lot that Microsoft can do to improve the
  OS, including taking some lessons from its rivals.
</p>

<h4>Seamless updates</h4>
<p>
  Screenshot of Windows Update in the Windows 11 Settings app with updates
  paused One of the big changes Microsoft announced for Windows 11 was for
  smaller updates to install in the background <br />to make the overall process
  less of a pain. While these changes are welcome, the process isn't quite as
  seamless as it could be. You have to download and <br />install updates, and
  then you have to reboot, which is when the computer makes a lot of the changes
  in the update.<br />
  Microsoft could stand to learn from ChromeOS and Android, which offer seamless
  updates where most of the changes are<br />
  done in the background. While you still need to reboot the device, it's pretty
  much a standard reboot where your PC boots back up with the new update
  installed.<br />
  Windows 11 still forces you to wait a while when it reboots to install
  updates, and while that's somewhat acceptable for big feature updates, it
  <br />shouldn't happen with the cumulative updates we get each month. That
  seems to be getting better with the new modular<br />
  version of Windows, though it would be great if it also applied to existing
  PCs.
</p>

<h4>Improvements to widgets</h4>
<p>
  Screenshot of a Windows 7 desktop with gadgets placed around the screen
  Desktop Gadgets in Windows 7 | Source: Redmond Pie The Widgets board on
  Windows 11 is full of potential, but so far, Microsoft hasn't really
  delivered. For over a year, only web-based widgets provided by Microsoft were
  supported, <br />and the Widgets board is also flooded with "news" articles
  powered by Microsoft Start, <br />which are rarely useful or entertaining. You
  can't disable them either. To that end, we have two wishes for widgets on
  Windows 11. First, we'd like more<br />
  customization options for the Widgets board. Users should be able to disable
  the news feed entirely and use the board exclusively for widgets so that it
  can be <br />
  truly useful to them and not filled with visual clutter. Additionally, for
  users who do want to see news, the Widgets board could serve as an RSS feed
  reader. Microsoft recently built a similar feature <br />directly into
  Microsoft Edge, and having this capability built directly into Windows would
  make it <br />that much easier for users to get access to news and articles
  from sources they curate. The other request is to bring widgets directly to
  the Windows desktop, which is essentially <br />how widgets work on Android.
  If you have widgets, there's a good chance you want quick access to the
  <br />information they present, and having them directly on the desktop would
  greatly help with that. Windows Vista and 7 already had this capability, and
  while it's not for everyone,<br />
  it could definitely be helpful. This is also something Apple recently
  announced with macOS Sonoma, so it's about time Microsoft does it too.
